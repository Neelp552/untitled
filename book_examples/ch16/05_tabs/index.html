                <p>Today, more than half of the 10,000 most-visited   websites use jQuery, and that number is growing every day. In fact,   jQuery has joined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as an essential part of   every web developer&rsquo;s resume.</p>
                <p>That's where this book comes in. Fast-paced, professional, and packed with real-world   examples, it delivers the jQuery expertise you need...and the JavaScript   knowledge you need to tweak  jQuery code for specific applications.   That's true whether you use it for step-by-step training or for   on-the-job reference.</p>

                <p>Due to our unique presentation methods and this book's modular organization,
				this is the right book for any web developer who wants to use JavaScript effectively. 
				That includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web developers who know HTML5 and CSS3 and are ready to master JavaScript and jQuery.</li> 
					<li>Web developers who program in ASP.NET, JSP, or PHP on the server side and 
					now want to master client-side programming.</li>
					<li>Web developers who have already read 3 or 4 JavaScript or jQuery books 
					but still don't know how to get the most from jQuery UI and jQuery plugins.</li>
